Description: Genomic variants can be analyzed and visualized using many
        tools. Unfortunately, number of tools for global interrogation
        of variants is limited. Package RareVariantVis aims to present
        genomic variants (especially rare ones) in a global, per
        chromosome way. Visualization is performed in two ways -
        standard that outputs png figures and interactive that uses
        JavaScript d3 package. Interactive visualization allows to
        analyze trio/family data, for example in search for causative
        variants in rare Mendelian diseases.
