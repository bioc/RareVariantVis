Description: Second version of RareVariantVis package aims to provide comprehensive information about rare variants for your genome data. 
        It annotates, filters and presents genomic variants (especially rare ones) in a global, per
        chromosome way. Large structural variants, including copy number variants are also supported. Package accepts variants directly from variant caller - for example GATK or Speedseq. 
        Output of package are lists of variants together with adequate visualization. 
        Visualization of variants is performed in two ways -
        standard that outputs png figures and interactive that uses
        JavaScript d3 package. Interactive visualization allows to
        analyze trio/family data, for example in search for causative
        variants in rare Mendelian diseases, in point-and-click interface. The package includes homozygous region caller and allows to analyse whole human genomes in less than 30 minutes on a desktop computer.
        RareVariantVis disclosed novel causes of several rare monogenic disorders, including one with non-coding causative variant - keratolythic winter erythema.
