Title: A suite for analysis of rare genomic variants in whole genome sequencing data.

Description: Genomic variants can be analysed and visualised using many
        tools. Unfortunately, number of tools for global interrogation
        of variants is limited. Second version of RareVariantVis package aims to annotate, filter and present
        genomic single nucleotide and structural variants (especially rare ones) in a global, per
        chromosome way. Input genomic variants can come directly from the caller - for example GATK or Speedseq. Visualization of variants is performed in two ways -
        standard that outputs png figures and interactive that uses
        JavaScript d3 package. Interactive visualization allows to
        analyze trio/family data, for example in search for causative
        variants in rare Mendelian diseases. The package includes homozygous region caller and allows to analyse whole human genomes in less than 30 minutes.
